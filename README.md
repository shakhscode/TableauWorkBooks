# Tableau Vizualizations- Tableau Workbooks
### Data visualization is fascinating for me. I can design interactive dashboards in three ways -
- Using python libraries like bokeh, panel etc.
- Using Tableau vizies.
- Using Excel charts.
### Here in this repository I pushed some of my tableau visualization workbooks. 
**Acknowledgement:** I learnt basics of Tableau from a [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/share/10472C3@WwN7QNyD5lykgkFXacYtHiISqmJVFUggItojJLyKnqayQ2ue3j2HbIj6HaQN3dSA). I want to thank the course instructor for providing the datasets and sharing his knowledge through the course.
